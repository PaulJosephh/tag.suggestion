 Tu ne peux pas perdre quelque chose si elle t&#8217;appartient. Garde les mains ouvertes, et laisse passer le soleil &#224; travers tes doigts...   Donne ton amour, vis ta vie. Abbey Lincoln&#8230;   &#160;   &#160; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2OO3vuk3r4       I think about the life I live  A figure made of clay  And think about the things I lost  The things I gave away   &#160;   And when I'm in a certain mood  I search the house and look  One night I found these magic words  In a magic book   &#160;   Throw It Away   Throw It Away  Give your love, live your life  Each and every day   &#160;   And keep your hand wide open  Let the sun shine through  'Cause you can never lose a thing  If it belongs to you   &#160;   There's a hand to rock the cradle  And a hand to help us stand  With a gentle kind of motion  As it moves across the land   &#160;   And the hand's unclenched and open  Gifts of life and love it brings  So keep your hand wide open  If you're needing anything   &#160;   Throw It Away   Throw It Away  Give your love, live your life  Each and every day   &#160;   And keep your hand wide open  Let the sun shine through  Cause you can never lose a thing  If it belongs to you   &#160;   Throw It Away   Throw It Away   Give your love, live your life   Each and every day   &#160;   And keep your hand wide open   Let the sun shine through   'Cause you can never lose a thing   If it belongs to you   &#160;   'Cause you can never lose a thing   If it belongs to you   You can never ever lose a thing   If it belongs to you     You can never ever lose a thing   If it belongs to you   You can never ever lose a thing   If it belongs to you   &#160;   Aga Zaryan     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LB6f8z_cpY&amp;feature=re...   &#160;   Laika     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDD1o5wl_2o&amp;feature=related   &#160;   Lezlie Harrison     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGJ0oRqQwWw
