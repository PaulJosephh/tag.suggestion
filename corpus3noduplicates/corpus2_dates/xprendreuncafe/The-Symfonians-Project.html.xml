        <text>It's been a long time that I and some people I know were looking after a place on the web to publish a  Symfony  developer profile, post a job offer, share contacts and/or project opportunities. There's been some initiatives  here  and  here , but nothing has really convinced me so far. So I've decided to write something on my own. 


 The name of the project is  Symfonians . It's available in a beta state and only in english language for now. 


 There must exist a lot of bugs, so feel free to report them if you use the service  


 Ah, last but not least, I imagine that the site won't display nice on IE6 (maybe on IE7 too), but for now I don't care as I don't have much time to loose on this kind of fascinating CSS hacking challenges
