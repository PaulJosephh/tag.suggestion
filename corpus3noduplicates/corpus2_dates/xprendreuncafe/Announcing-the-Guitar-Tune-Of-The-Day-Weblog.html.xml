        <text>I must admit it, I am a guitarist. Not a good one, but I like playing the instrument, and listening to good guitar players. So Ive just opened a little blog, the  Guitar Tune Of The Day blog  which aims to present a song I like, every day if I can. 


 Oh, and happy end of year people.
