        <text>Ive just stumbled upon a nice new feature of  Symfony  1.3, the ability to  open any linked file within standard exception page with the text editor of your choice , at least if it provides an url scheme/protocol to open them.  Texmate provides natively this feature , so lets see how to configure a symfony project to allow its files to be opened directly in textmate when encountering a stack trace. 


 In the  config/  folder of the project, create a  settings.yml  file with this content: 

  yml
dev: #yeah, we never know
  .settings:
    file_link_format: "txmt://open?url=file://%fline=%l"
 


 Thats it. Now any standard exception page (in  dev  environment only, right?) will provide a  txmt://  link to every PHP file listed in the stack trace. And at the correct line number. Neat.
