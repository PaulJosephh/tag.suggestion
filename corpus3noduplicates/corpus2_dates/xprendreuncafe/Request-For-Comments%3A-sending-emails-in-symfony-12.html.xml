        <text>There should be a standard way for sending emails in upcoming symfony 1.2, and Im in charge of implementing it, using the  excellent   SwiftMailer  library. So Ive created a  dedicated RFC page on the symfony wiki  just to get your opinions on the Right Way It Should Be Done. 


 If youre interested, theres also a  dedicated thread on the devs mailing list . 


 Edit:  Swift integration didnt make it for symfony 1.2, and here are my main reasons: 

 
 I didnt get enough time 
 Swift is strangely coded from an architecture point of view: you must override the SMTP connection class to be able to send a mail using PHP  mail()  native function; so its hard to extend or tweak it easily 
 I didnt get enough time 
 Swift looked like a dead project  at the time  symfony 1.2 was released 
 I didnt get enough time 
 

 To be honnest Id like to see it integrated for symfony 1.3, but maybe with another lib Stay tuned.
