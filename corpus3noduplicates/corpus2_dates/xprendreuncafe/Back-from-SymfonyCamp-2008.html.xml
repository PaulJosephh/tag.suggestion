        <text>Im back from the  symfony camp 2008 . Its been a really great pleasure to meet the community [ 1 ] , there are so many smart people using symfony all around the world, its just amazing. 


 I gave a one day training session on symfony 1.1 to eleven attendees the day before, I think it was somewhat interesting even if it may have been too short to see every important aspects of the framework 


 The conferences were also great, and some slides are already available:
