        <text>Looks like people seems to  appreciate  the service provided by  Symfonians.net . At least, they use it ! Here's some stats, three days after the site  has been launched  : 

 
 159  members  has registered  [ 1 ] 
 42  recommendations  has been given  [ 2 ] 
 56  applications  has been added in the directory 
 40  companies  has been submitted 
 9   job offers  has been published 
 A dozen XSS/CSRF attack attempts. Ouch! 
 

 I've just added some more cumulative filtering features on people, applications and jobs lists, so now you can : 

 
 filter people available for hire, from a given country 
 filter applications from a given country, filter only opensource ones  [ 3 ] 
 filter job offers proposed by a company, in a country and eventually accepting teleworking  [ 4 ] 
 

 I've also slighly microformatted some detailled views like company and person pages, using  hCard . 


 By the way, I want to mention that if your cocain is  Django , you might use the  DjangoPeople  service, very nicely done and proven useful. Makes me think I must push on some geolocalization features on Symfonians... Stay tuned. 


 Edit:  We got (roughly alpha)  maps . 
 Notes 
 [ 1 ] Too bad I had some mail blacklist problem :/ Stay tuned for a blog post on this issue. 
 [ 2 ] I had two, one of them is about the fact I play the guitar  
 [ 3 ] Four opensource applications on five  are french  \o/ 
 [ 4 ] Play, say Hi!
