        <text>Sorry for the lame title of this blog post, but Im happy enough to announce the immediate availability of both  symfony 1.2   and   Jobeet , the new  symfony advent calendar ! 


 Jobeet  It is a set of 24 tutorials, published day-by-day between December 1st and Christmas. Each tutorial is meant to last one hour, and will be the occasion to see the ongoing development of a web application with symfony, from A to Z. 


 So dont hesitate to  start reading day one of this great tutorial   


 Edit:  I forgot to mention the simultaneous release of the  symfony and Doctrine book
