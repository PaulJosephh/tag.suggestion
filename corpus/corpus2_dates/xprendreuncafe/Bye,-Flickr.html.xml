 In some hours, maybe days, my  flickr account  will be destroyed, and its content will be gone, definitely. 

 Looks like Flickr doesnt allow "sales links" within photo description: 

 

 That doesnt fit my way of thinking my expensive hobby. I know, by putting links to  redbubble  Im breaking the terms of service agreement, so Im the culprit, and Flickr is safe. 

 Bye Flickr, after 5 years of paying my "pro" account fees, Im a bit sad to leave the community, but I cant stand paying for a service which doesnt allow me to manage my stuff the way I want. Especially when some  Interesting   photos   of the day , highlighted by Flickr itself in its explore RSS feed, are using the same kind of links, but are still there, safe. 

 Double standards? Not for me, thanks. Bye. 

 PS: When Ill have a new dedicated self-hosted website, Ill keep you informed here. In the meanwhile, feel free to  reach me at redbubble . 

 Edit: Done, flickr account is gone.  All the data it contained have been retrieved using the awesome  photobackup  utility, give it a go, even for backuping your flickr stream: it just works.
