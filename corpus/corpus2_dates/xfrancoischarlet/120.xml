 According to figures  published  by a major tech provider, the Internet carries 1,826 Petabytes of information per day. In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6 percent of that. However, of the 1.6 percent of the data, only 0.025 percent is actually selected for review. The net effect is that NSA analysts look at 0.00004 percent of the world's traffic in conducting their mission&#8212;that's less than one part in a million. [...]&#160;That means  the NSA is "touching" more data than Google processes every day  (a mere 20 petabytes).
