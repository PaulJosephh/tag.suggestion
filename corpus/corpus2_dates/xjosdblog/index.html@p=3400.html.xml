In the perspective of annotating a text with respect to an ontology, we have participated in the sub-task 1 of the Bacteria Biotopes BioNLP Shared Task whose aim is to detect, in the text, Bacteria Habitats and associate to them one or several categories from the Onto-Biotope ontology provided for the task. 
 
We have used a rule-based machine learning algorithm (WHISK) combined with a rule-based automatic ontology projection method and some rote learning. The combination of these three sources of rules leads to good results with a SER measure close to the winner and the best F-measure.
 
 
 
 
The sub-task 1 of the BB BioNLP-ST ranks competitors using the SER measure that must be as close as possible to0. We are quite close to the winner with a SER of 48,7% against 46%. Our F-measure (60,8%) is even better than the winners F-measure (57%). Without our mistake, we would have been placed equal first with a far better F-measure (62,9%).
